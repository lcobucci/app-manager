# App manager

Just playing around with some stuff (of course it's just a POC)

## Why?

I'm tired of having to create controllers for applications and so I decided to
implement an idea that I had for quite some time: automate routing using command
and query buses.

With that we have less code to maintain and can focus on what really matters,
our Domain and Application layers.
